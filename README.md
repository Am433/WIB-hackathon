AI and IoT Integration for Real-Time Prediction of Depressive Crises
Overview
This project integrates artificial intelligence and Internet of Things technologies to predict depressive crises in real-time. The project consists of two main components:

An AI algorithm for predicting depressive crises based on physiological and behavioral data.
An IoT system for collecting real-time data from wearable sensors and transmitting it to the AI algorithm.
AI Algorithm
Description
The AI algorithm utilizes a decision tree classifier to analyze real-time data collected from wearable sensors and predict the likelihood of depressive crises. The algorithm continuously updates its model based on incoming data and makes predictions in real-time.

Implementation
Language: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, numpy
Model: Decision Tree Classifier
Real-Time Data Collection: Simulated using a function (collect_data()) to generate random sample data.
Continuous Training: The model is updated using the partial_fit() method for online learning.
IoT System
Description
The IoT system consists of wearable devices equipped with sensors for measuring physiological signals such as EMG, GSR, ECG, and EEG. These devices communicate with a central hub ESP32 in our case via Wi-Fi and MQTT protocols. The hub collects real-time data from sensors and publishes it to an MQTT broker 

Implementation
Platform: ESP32 microcontroller
Language: C/C++
Libraries: WiFi, PubSubClient
Sensors: EMG, GSR, ECG, EEG
Communication Protocol: MQTT
Usage
Set up the AI algorithm in a Python environment with scikit-learn and numpy installed.
Modify the collect_data() function to collect real-time data from your wearable sensors.
Run the AI algorithm script to continuously collect, preprocess, and predict depressive crises based on real-time data.
Set up the IoT system on an ESP32 microcontroller with required libraries and sensor connections.
Configure Wi-Fi and MQTT settings in the ESP32 code.
Upload the ESP32 code to the microcontroller and monitor real-time data transmission using an MQTT client.
